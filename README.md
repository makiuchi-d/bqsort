# bqsort
Binary quicksort for Go.

Binary quicksort is a in-space binary MSD radix sort.
The cost of this algorithm is **O(n*k)**, where *n* is the element count and *k* is the number of bits in the max key value.
This algorithm is advantageous when the number of keys is limited and the number of elements is large.
